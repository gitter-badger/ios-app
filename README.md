## Preamble

I'm open sourcing this sideproject of mine as I'm not enough time to actively care about it and due to the high number of requests I've got from the community, it feels about right to make further work to it possible.

#### So you're going open source now, what about my data, is it also going open source?
No, no, no. Of course not, you're data is still stored on the Locative servers and it will stay there until further notice. No third party will have access to your data.

## Technologies used

Objective-C, Swift and dependency management using CocoaPods (>= 1.0).

## Development

The following commands will clone this repository and spin up the dev environment.

```
git clone https://github.com/LocativeHQ/Locative-iOS
cd Locative-iOS
bundle install
bundle exec rake dev
```

## Changelog

The `github_changelog_generator` gem is used to generate a changelog.

To generate the most current changelog perform

```
bundle install
bundle exec rake changelog
```

## Deployment

I'm going to regularly deploy releases to the App Store.

## Issues

Right now I'm still getting issues / feature requests etc. reported via UserVoice but I'm planning on moving to GitHub issues with this.
